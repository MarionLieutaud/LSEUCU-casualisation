# LSEUCU-casualisation
Code for the report on casualisation at LSE - macro and comparative analyses of HESA data.

All of the analyses are based on publicly-available data published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).
This data can be directly downloaded on the HESA website: www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis. 

If you re-use the code for your own analyses, please credit LSE UCU and the author Marion Lieutaud (LSE UCU anti-casualisation chair).
