# LSEUCU-casualisation
Code for the 2023 LSE UCU report on academic casualisation at LSE, entitled "The Crisis of Academic Casualisation at LSE". Includes macro and comparative analyses of 2023 HESA data (code, output and data included), analyses of LSE internal HR data (code and output included but not the data) and figures from the 2023 LSE Postdoc and Fellows Survey (only output included). The full report, with more detailed descriptions of the data, analyses and interpretation, is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQiPscs_epkMnBdPyp-h8Wosyuw1oWVgsOHnFivDELE.

All of the HESA analyses are based on publicly-available data published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). 
This data can be directly downloaded on the HESA website: www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis. We have also included the HESA datafiles (with practical names and formatting) in this repository.

This code was picked up and expanded by Yusuf Imaad Khan who made many of the HESA-based plots interactive so one could easily see visualisations for casualisation trends in any higher education provider in the HESA data. Khan's blog post and interactive plots are available here: https://www.yusufimaadkhan.com/posts/lseucu_casualisation_yik/ and the forked github repository with the interactive layer is available here: https://github.com/yusufimaadkhan/LSEUCU-casualisation-YIK.
